# Lab Details

# Lab 2 — Using Constants
Objective:
Learn how to declare and use **constant variables** in C++.  

**Key Concepts:**
- Constant variables (`const` keyword)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Input/output using `cin` and `cout`
- Syntax correctness and readability

---

# Lab 3 — Comments & Data Types
**Objective:**  
Build upon Lab 2 by integrating **comments**, **data types**, and **constant variables** to create more structured and documented code.

**Key Concepts:**
- Single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments  
- Fundamental data types: `int`, `float`, `char`, `double`, `bool`
- Constant variable usage (review from Lab 2)
- Program structure and readability improvement
